A hierarchical note management system with Dendron-like features.

This tool brings hierarchical note management capabilities to your vault, inspired by Dendron. It allows you to organize your notes in a tree-like structure, making it easier to navigate and manage large knowledge bases.

(While Dot Navigator maintains some compatibility with Dendron-structured notes, future compatibility is not guaranteed. It is primarily intended for use with notes in your vault, utilizing a Dendron-like structure)

## Installation

Until the plugin is officially released, you can install it through BRAT (Beta Review and Testing)

- **Performance optimized for large vaults**, meaning you can expand all 10K notes of your vault at once on your phone, it will still run and scroll smoothly ðŸ‘Œ
- **Optimized for mobile as well as desktop**, (e.g. the top menu on desktop is at the bottom of the screen on mobile for easier access)

(Img coming soon)

- **Persistent expanded state across sessions** (the tree view will remember which nodes are expanded or collapsed when you close/reopen the app)
- **Horizontal scrolling** support for deeply nested structures (you can write very long path notes and scroll horizontally to see the full path of the note)
- **UI for renaming a note and its children** with a nice UI

(Img coming soon)

- **Undo the last rename operation** that was done in the rename dialog of the plugin

(Img coming soon)
