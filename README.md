# Tree Mapper

![CleanShot 2025-03-17 at 00 25 39@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aa914d7-3602-4b9d-8cba-9c50840438b3)

A hierarchical note management system with Dendron-like features.

This tool brings hierarchical note management capabilities to your vault, inspired by Dendron. It allows you to organize your notes in a tree-like structure, making it easier to navigate and manage large knowledge bases.

(While Tree Mapper maintains some compatibility with Dendron-structured notes, future compatibility is not guaranteed. It is primarily intended for use with notes in your vault, utilizing a Dendron-like structure)

## Features

- Hierarchical note organization with a tree-like interface
- Create child notes directly from the hierarchy view
- Support all file types
- Works on mobile as well as desktop
