A hierarchical note management system with Dendron-like features.

This tool brings hierarchical note management capabilities to your vault, inspired by Dendron. It allows you to organize your notes in a tree-like structure, making it easier to navigate and manage large knowledge bases.

(While Dot Navigator maintains some compatibility with Dendron-structured notes, future compatibility is not guaranteed. It is primarily intended for use with notes in your vault, utilizing a Dendron-like structure)

## Installation

Until the plugin is officially released, you can install it through BRAT (Beta Review and Testing)
1. <a href="https://jeansordes.github.io/redirect?to=obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian42-brat" target="_blank">Install the BRAT plugin</a> if you don't have it already
2. <a href="https://jeansordes.github.io/redirect?to=obsidian://brat?plugin=jeansordes/dot-navigator" target="_blank">Install Dot Navigator using BRAT</a>

## Features

- **Hierarchical note organization** with a tree-like interface
- **Instant loading with IndexedDB caching**, the tree view loads instantly even for large vaults by caching the tree structure
- **Performance optimized for very large vaults**, meaning you can expand all 10K notes from your vault at once on your phone, it will still run and scroll smoothly ðŸ‘Œ
- **Designed and optimized for mobile before desktop** with lazy loading of suggestions for better mobile performance
- **Rule-based suggestions** that surface virtual child notes based on configurable JSON rules so you can scaffold structures before the notes exist

- **Persistent expanded state across sessions** (the tree view will remember which nodes are expanded or collapsed when you close/reopen the app)
- **Horizontal scrolling** support for deeply nested structures (you can write very long path notes and scroll horizontally to see the full path of the note)
- **UI for renaming a note and its children** with a nice UI

- **Undo the last rename operation** that was done in the rename dialog of the plugin (through the UI or with a command dedicated for that)

- **YAML title support** - displays custom titles from frontmatter instead of filenames (e.g. `prj.md` with the property `title = "Projects"` will be displayed as `Projects` in the tree view)

- **Internationalization support**, based on the language set in the settings, defaulting to English. (As of now, only English and French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· are supported, you can request a new language by creating an issue)

## Rule Configuration

Dot Navigator supports **rule-based suggestions** that automatically suggest virtual child notes for existing files. This allows you to scaffold note hierarchies before the actual notes exist.

### Setting Up Rule Configuration

1. **Create a configuration file** named `dot-navigator-rules.json` in your vault root, or specify a custom path in settings
2. **Define rules** as a JSON array of rule objects

### Rule Syntax

Each rule object can have these properties:

- **`pattern`** (required): String or array of strings defining which files to match
- **`exclude`** (optional): String or array of strings defining files to exclude from matching
- **`children`** (required): Array of strings defining suggested child note names

### Pattern Syntax

Dot Navigator uses enhanced glob patterns with special wildcards:

- **`*`** matches any sequence of characters **within a single path segment** (stops at dots)
- **`**`** matches any sequence of characters **across multiple path segments** (matches dots)

For more complex pattern matching, you can use **regex patterns** by prefixing with `/`.

### Examples

```json
[
  {
    "pattern": ["prj.*"],
    "children": ["roadmap", "ideas", "issues"]
  },
  {
    "pattern": ["work.**"],
    "exclude": ["work.archives"],
    "children": ["notes", "tasks"]
  },
  {
    "pattern": ["/^blog\\.2025\\.[0-9]$/"],
    "children": ["draft", "published"]
  }
]
```

**What this does:**
- Files matching `prj.*` (like `prj.frontend`, `prj.backend`) will suggest children `roadmap`, `ideas`, `issues`
- Files matching `work.**` (like `work.tasks`, `work.2024.tasks`, `work.deep.nested`) will suggest `notes`, `tasks` (except `work.archives`)
- Files matching `/^blog\.2025\.[0-9]$/` (regex for single-digit months) will suggest `draft`, `published`

### Configuration File Location

The configuration can be stored in:

1. **JSON file**: `dot-navigator-rules.json` (recommended)
2. **Markdown file**: `dot-navigator-rules.md` with JSON in a code block:

   ````markdown
   # Dot Navigator Rules

   ```json
   [
     {
       "pattern": ["prj.*"],
       "children": ["roadmap", "ideas"]
     }
   ]
   ```
   ````

### Creating the Configuration File

1. Open the **Dot Navigator settings** in Obsidian
2. Go to **Schema Configuration** section
3. Click **"Create new file"** to generate a template
4. Edit the generated file with your rules

The plugin will automatically reload rules when the configuration file changes.

## Available Commands

Dot Navigator provides several commands that can be accessed via the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+P):

### Core Navigation
- **Open Tree View**: Opens the Dot Navigator View in the left sidebar
- **Show File in Tree View**: Highlights and reveals the current file in the tree view
- **Collapse All Nodes in Tree**: Collapses all nodes in the tree view
- **Expand All Nodes in Tree**: Expands all nodes in the tree view
- **Open Closest Parent Note**: Opens the nearest existing parent note of the current file (checks dotted parents like `a.b.c` â†’ `a.b` â†’ `a`)

### Note creation
- **Create Child Note**: Will create a new child note for the currently active file with the node name being "untitled" (e.g. if you trigger this command on `a.md`, it will create `a.untitled.md`) and will open the rename dialog for the new note (you can customize the name of the new note in the settings)

### Rename
- **Rename Current File**: Opens the rename dialog for the current file or folder
- **Undo Last Rename Operation**: Reverses the most recent rename operation
