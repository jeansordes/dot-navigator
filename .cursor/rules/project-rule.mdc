- Adopt a functionnal approach as much as possible in the project (rather than OOP) so that tests can be easier to code
- When coding tests for a function, don't try to instanciate App, but call the function you are trying to test directly
- When building the project, use "npm run build", not "npm run dev"
- Don't try to create commits on your own, let the user handle this
- For icons, use the setIcons function (setIcon(parent: HTMLElement, iconId: IconName): void), and the iconId is the name of the icon in the Lucide icon library
- You don't need to run tests or build, simply use the linting to check for errors
- Use debug module instead of console.log to log messages to the console
- Don't add accessibility attributes to the DOM, it's not needed for this plugin
- When a variable is declared but not used: if it contains a DOM element created with createElement/createEl, keep the creation but remove the variable assignment (e.g., change `const el = parent.createEl('div')` to `parent.createEl('div')` instead of removing the line entirely)
