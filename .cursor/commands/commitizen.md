Generate a commit message in the commitizen style, and output it in a code block, so that the user can easily copy it.

Analyze the current git status and staged changes to determine the appropriate commit type (feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore, etc.), affected scope, and provide a clear description of what changed.
